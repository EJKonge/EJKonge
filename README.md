### Hi there 👋

My name is Elias and I have spent most of my life studying, during which I have mostly done minor or part-time jobs. Even though I was
studying physics at university, I most enjoyed the IT-based modules, until I finally decided I was more passionate
about IT and wanted to start my career in IT. This led me to recently graduate from AiCore, which is the most industry-informed hands-on accelerator for AI
and Machine Learning training. In my teen years, I always pursued knowledge and the unknown,
which is one of the major reasons I initially pursued physics, and one of the reasons I am attracted to
troubleshooting and problem-solving. The AI industry is a rapidly evolving world that requires people to stay updated
with the newest knowledge in order to succeed and I thrive in fast-paced environments. <br>

My most current skills are: <br>

🐍 Python <br>
🔧 Engineering <br>
📊 Machine Learning <br>
🤖 Deep Learning (Tensorflow and Pytorch) <br>

I hope you like my github page, this is a collection of my personal projects as well as some projects that I worked on during my AiCore journey.<br>

If you have any question about any repo, or want to contact me, don't hesitate to:<br>
